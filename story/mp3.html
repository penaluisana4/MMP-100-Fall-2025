        <h1>Welcome to my world!</h1>
        <p>this final session was a great experience that deepened my understanding of audio production. The main idea behind my sound project was to capture the feeling of a weekend escape to a sunny getaway. Transitioning from the rush and noise of everyday life to a calm, relaxing environment. Through this, I focused on using dynamics and compression to balance the mix, applying EQ to clean up unwanted static, and mastering each element to make the final result pop. It was especially fun to learn how audio waves and frequencies work, and how to shape volume curves to create smooth transitions between sounds. This process really gave me a clearer sense of what mastering a sound or song involves, and how technical adjustments can bring creative ideas to life.</p>
