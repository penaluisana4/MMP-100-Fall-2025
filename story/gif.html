        <p>For this animated gif, I wanted to do a drop of water falling down where it suddenly makes a gigantic crater which makes some sort of explosion in which all of it disappear, and finally the the water drop greets you for watching the show.</p>

        <p>After applying the frame by frame technique learned in class, and how not to overlap objects / lines because they cut themself if not manage the frame edits properly. I hand draw the crater and other graphics with the brush tool, and created the water drop with oval tool. The rest was just managing the moves on the next frames.</p>
