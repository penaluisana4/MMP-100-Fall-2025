        <p>For this project, I wanted to create a sunrise effect, showcasing a city skyline with clouds on the horizon as the sun rises. I really enjoyed using Tweens, as they help automate object movements and offer endless possibilities for transitions, such as scaling from small to large. I also liked experimenting with the bird symbol example, which added a dynamic and creative touch to the animation.</p>
